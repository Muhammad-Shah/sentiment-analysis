## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone or attitude conveyed by a piece of writing, such as a product review, social media post, or news article. This project aims to provide a tool that can automatically analyze text data and provide a sentiment score or classification.

## Features

- Supports text data preprocessing, including removing chatwords, HTML tags, URLs, and punctuations.
- Uses deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM, to classify text data as positive or negative sentiment.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for loading and analyzing text data.
- Offers visualization of sentiment scores and classifications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammad-Shah/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the text data you want to analyze.
2. Preprocess the text data by removing chatwords, HTML tags, URLs, and punctuations.
3. Split the text data into sentences.
4. Tokenize the sentences into words.
5. Train an LSTM model on the preprocessed data.
6. Use the trained model to classify the text data as positive or negative sentiment.
